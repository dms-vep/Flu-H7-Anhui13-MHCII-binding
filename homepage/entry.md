# Effects of H7 HA mutations on entry in cells expressing tufted duck MHC-II or sialic acid

This page shows how mutations to H7 HA affect its ability to mediate pseudovirus entry in cells expressing no sialic acid but tufted duck MHC-II, or in cells expressing sialic acid.

## Differences in how mutations affect entry in various cells

Most HA mutations have similar effects on entry in cells expressing tufted duck MHC-II or sialic acid---however, mutations at key sites involved in interacting with MHC-II or sialic acid have different effects in different target cells.

The interactive plot below shows how each HA mutation affects entry into:
 - 293T cells which express primarily a2-3-linked but also some a2-6-linked sialic acids
 - cells expressing no sialic acid but tufted duck MHC-II

The line plot shows the total difference in effects of mutations at each site (using [H3 numbering](numbering)) on a pair of cells.
Sites with large positive or negative values have mutations that are more favorable for entry in one cell than another.

Clicking on a site in the line plot makes the scatter plot to the right display the mutation-level effects for that site in the two cell lines.
It also makes the heat maps at bottom show the effects of all mutations at that site (and neighboring sites) on entry in all cell lines. 
In the heat maps, red shades indicates a mutation impairs entry, blue indicates a mutation enhances on entry, grey indicates no mutationwas made for a mutation, and `x` indicates the wildtype amino acid in the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) HA.
Mouse over mutations on the heatmap for details.

## HA structure colored by mutation effects on entry in MHC-II versus sialic acid expressing cells
Below is the H7 HA structure showing the sites where mutations have different effects on entry in sialic-acid versus tufted duck MHC-II expressing cells on H5 HA structure.
Red indicates sites where mutations are more deleterious for entry in  MHC-II expressing cells, and blue indicates sites where mutations are more deleterious for entry in sialic-acid expressing cells.
