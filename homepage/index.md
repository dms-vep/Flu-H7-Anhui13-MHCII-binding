## Overview

This website provides interactive visualizations and links to numerical data from pseudovirus deep mutational scanning measuring how mutations to an H7 HA (from A/Anhui/1/2013 affect its interaction with tufted duck MHC-II.

For details about the study, see [Dadonaite et al. (2026)]() [**ADD CITATION**].

Visualizations and data can be accessed by clicking the gray boxes above for each type of measurement, namely:
 - [Effects of H7 HA mutations on entry in cells expressing tufted duck MHC-II or sialic acid](entry)
 - [Effects of H7 HA mutations on binding to tufted duck MHC-II](binding)
 - [Explanation of the H3 HA numbering scheme used in plots shown here](numbering)

For numerical values of the effects of H7 HA mutations (H3 numbering) on interaction with MHC-II, see [this CSV](https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu-H7-Anhui13-MHCII-binding/blob/master/results/summaries/tufted_duck_MHCII_binding.csv).

For the full computer code and all numerical data files, see [the GitHub repository](https://github.com/dms-vep/Flu-H7-Anhui13-MHCII-binding).
For full documentation of the computational pipeline, see the [Appendix](appendix.html){target="_self"}.


## Biosafety
The experimental measurements were made using [pseudovirus deep mutational scanning](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cell.2023.02.001) with [lentiviral particles pseudotyped](https://blog.addgene.org/viral-vectors-101-pseudotyping) with HA.
These pseudoviruses do not encode any viral proteins other than HA, and so are only able to undergo a single round of cell entry and are **not** fully replicative agents capable of spreading or causing disease.
They therefore provide a safe way to study mutations to the HA protein at biosafety-level-2 outside the context of actual pathogenic influenza.
The specific H7 HA pseudovirus deep mutational scanning libraries used for these experiments have [been previously described](https://academic.oup.com/ve/article/12/1/veag018/8534428).

See the biosafety statement in the paper about this study ([Dadonaite et al. (2026)]() [**ADD CITATION**]) for additional details.
