# Effects of H& HA mutations on binding to tufted duck MHC-II VLPs

This page shows how mutations to H7 HA affect binding to tufted duck MHC-II virus-like particles (VLPs), as assessed by the ability of these VLPs to neutralize pseudovirus infectivity.
Note that because the MHC-II VLPs may also contain other cell membrane proteins, some of the HA mutations may also affect binding to this proteins as well as MHC-II.

## Heatmap of how mutations affect tufted duck MHCII-VLP binding

In the interactive chart below, the line plot shows the total effects of mutations at each site in HA on MHC-II VLP binding, and the heatmap shows the effects of individual mutations.

The heatmap shows the effects of individual mutations: positive values (blue) indicate mutations increase binding (as assessed by increased MHC-II VLP neutralization of pseudovirus) and negative values (orange) indicate mutations decrease binding.
Light gray in the heatmap means a mutation was not measured, and dark gray means the mutation wsa so deleterious for HA-mediated cell entry that it was not possible to reliably estimate its effect on MHC-II binding.
The `x` for each site indicates the wildtype amino acid in the A/Anhui/1/2013 (H7N9) HA.
Mouse over mutations on the heatmap for details.

## HA structure colored by mutation effects on MHC-II binding

Below is structure of H7 HA colored by the total effect of all mutations at each site on tufted duck MHC-II VLP binding.
Red indicates sites where most mutations decrease MHCII-VLP binding and  blue indicates sites where most mutations increase MHCII-VLP binding
